HeapStats
===================

HeapStats is Java troubleshooting tool.
This tool is composed of three programs:

* Agent
 * HeapStats JVMTI agent.
* Analyzer
 * HeapStats GUI analyzer.
* CLI
 * HeapStats commandline analyzer.


## Agent ##

You can attach HeapStats agent as below:

* -agentlib:heapstats[=conf]
 * If libheapstats.so is located at LD_LIBRARY_PATH, you can pass -agentlib option to java.
* -agentpath:/path/to/heapstats[=conf]
 * Pass libheapstats.so with -agentpath option to java.
* heapstats-attacher
 * If you want to attach HeapStats to existed process, you can use this script.

If you want to set specified configuration, you can pass it to -agentlib/-agentpath after "=config file" .


## Analyzer ##

HeapStats analyzer is GUI application for analyzing HeapStats SnapShot.
You can run it on any GUI environment which has JavaFX runtime.

HeapStats analyzer supports JDP autodiscovery and Error Report Transmission.

### JDP ###

The automatic discovery function of JDP (Java Discovery Protocol) can be
enabled by the following JVM options.

```
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=<JMX port>
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=<true|false>
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=<true|false>
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.autodiscovery=true
```

The JDP function sends a packet at regular intervals: 5 seconds by default.
If analyzer can NOT receive a JDP packet from a monitoring JVM instance,
the instance's name displayed on the screen will become orange.

### Error Report Transmission ###

OracleJDK can provide a real-time detection of JVM crash, but OpenJDK does
NOT support it. In addition, OracleJDK needs to be run with the following options.

```
-XX:+TransmitErrorReport
-XX:ErrorReportServer=<address>:<port (4711 by default)>
```

## CLI ##

If you want to analyze HeapStats SnapShot on CUI environment, you can use HeapStats CLI.

  $ java -jar heapstats-cli.jar

If you want to see details, please run heapstats-cli with -help .
