2. How to build

  (1) run configure with path to JDK 8

       $ ./configure --with-jdk=/path/to/JDK8

      *HINT* HeapStats Analyzer requires JavaFX 8.
             OpenJDK does not provide JavaFX. Open source JavaFX is OpenJFX.
             If you have not installed OpenJFX, You have to pass OracleJDK8.

  (2) run make
       $ make

      *HINT* If your machine does not have JavaFX (OpenJFX or OracleJDK),
             you can avoid to build HeapStats Analyzer as below:

               $ make agent  <- build HeapStats agent
               $ make mbean  <- build HeapStats MBean
               $ mvn -am -pl analyzer/cli package  <- build HeapStats CLI


  configure script provides several useful options.
  If you want to know them, please run "./configure --help" .


3. How to install

  run make install
    $ su -
    # cd /path/to/source
    # make install
